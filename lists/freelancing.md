## Marketplaces

- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com): Upwork is like the "bread and butter" for freelance programmers, its history goes back all the way to the merging of two different platforms called **eLance** and **oDesk** who used to rule the freelance marketplace once upon a time! You must be careful in choosing your clients here though in all fairness, they've done a good job of vetting the platform in recent years.
- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com): A good freelance site in its own niche for quick and short-term jobs with limited budgets. Fiverr is different from typical platforms where the client posts a requirement and many freelancers bid on that like a tender system. On Fiverr, the freelancer creates something called a "gig" or service which the client pays for and thus starts a contract. Despite the name, you get many good paying projects which can continue well into long term.
- [FiveSquid](https://www.fivesquid.com): Its the British version of Fiverr, only difference is that you get paid in British Pounds (GBP) instead of USD. Also, the website lacks some features compared to Fiverr (such as the ability to send a customized offer in the free membership plan, read various statistics about your gigs, etc).
- [Guru](http://www.guru.com): Yet another freelance portal, maybe not as good as Upwork/Fiverr, but still better than Freelancer.com.
- [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com): Though its the second most popular portal in the freelance world after Upwork, there have been reports of many scammy things from here. A major red flag is that they want developers to pay the commission upfront, even before they are paid for their first project. You also need to be VERY careful, not to click on their shady membership adverts that trick you into handing back all your hard earned money to them.
- [Golance](https://golance.com): Joined this site recently, seems very promising from what I've heard on Reddit, personally, I'm yet to land on a project here.
- [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#expect-top-tier-devs): Toptal is a global network of top software engineers and designers with a hiring rate of less than 3%. Toptal works with clients to understand their project/team needs and custom-matches them with pre-screened developers and designers who join their teams on a full-time, part-time, or hourly basis.
- [/r/ForHire](http://www.reddit.com/r/ForHire): Yet another good place to find jobs, though some of their rules are way too silly and appear prejudiced. For example, I was banned from this subreddit, just because my hourly rate was "too low".
- [Pilot](https://pilot.co) - Pilot is a software platform that removes all the pain from contract work. We find work, negotiate contracts, send invoices and chase payments for hundreds of forward-looking engineers and designers around the world.
