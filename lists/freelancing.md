## Marketplaces

- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com): Upwork is like the "bread and butter" for freelance programmers, its history goes back all the way to the merging of two different platforms called **eLance** and **oDesk** who used to rule the freelance marketplace once upon a time. However, the fees are slightly higher higher at 20% though it gets lesser as your sales increase.
- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com): A good freelance site in its own niche for quick and short-term jobs with limited budgets. Fiverr is different from typical platforms where the client posts a requirement and many freelancers bid on that like a tender system. On Fiverr, the freelancer creates something called a "gig" or service which the client pays for and thus starts a contract. Despite the name, you get many good paying projects which can continue well into long term.
- [FiveSquid](https://www.fivesquid.com): It's the British version of Fiverr, only difference is that you get paid in GBP instead of USD.
- [Guru](http://www.guru.com): Yet another freelance portal though not as popular as Upwork/Fiverr among freelancers.
- [Freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com): Few years ago, this site had got infamous for scams but recently, they seem to have done a nice job of keeping bad actors out. Nevertheless, a freelancer should always be on alert for such things irrespective of which platform it is.
- [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#expect-top-tier-devs): They market themselves as a global network of top software engineers and designers with a hiring rate of less than 3%. However, cracking their super difficult algorithms and making it to the interview rounds is like near impossible unless you're a Newton or an Einstein!
